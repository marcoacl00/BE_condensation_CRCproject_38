# BE_condensation_CRCproject_38

This is a repository for the project in the ambit of the subject "Network Science" 2021/22, Instituto Superior Técnico.

In order to run the code, it's highly recomended to use Jupyter Notebook. We are using the following packages: Numpy, Scipy, NetworkX and Matplotlib.


Note to the professor: This is the second project we are actually doing. Before starting this project,
we tried to develop a cascade-based effects project but we decided that another kind of project was a better idea.
